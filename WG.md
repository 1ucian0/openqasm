# OpenQASM Working Groups

As outlined in the OpenQASM governance document (ADD LINK HERE), the Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
will, from time to time, elect to create **Working Groups** (WG) to study issues. The TSC will appoint a **Contributor**
as **Chair** for each WG. A WG shall submit a language RFC or pull request to the OpenQASM specification
for review by the TSC at an agreed upon date. A WG will be automatically disbanded upon acceptance or
(final) rejection of the RFC/pull request.
